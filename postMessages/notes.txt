window.postMessage

parent sends message
parent listens for confirmation message
child listens for message
child sends confirmation

postMessage works for:
  Between iframes and parent windows
  Between windows/tabs opened with window.open()
  Between worker threads (Web Workers) and main thread
  Between browser windows from the same origin
  Between service workers and web pages

The basic syntax remains similar:

--------------------
for project 1:
  php -S localhost:8000 listener.html
  php -S localhost:8001 sender.html
  go to localhost:8001

cross domain and cross window communication // document.domain | Window.postMessage

// <input name='{"amount":100, "to":"attacker", "': value='"}' />
--------------------

//research
  window.opener.postMessage({},"https://our.intern.facebook.com")

I can have my own site that can open a window and then replace the url I have to navigate to another window

window.opener // gives me the url the website was opened from


apps.facebook.com
  inside of it there is the iframe (app.example.com)

apps.facebook.com (postMessage)-> page_proxy (post http)-> iframe
I care about app is sending to proxy

// send postMessage to the opener which is "https://our.alfa.facebook.com"
our.opener.postMessage({
    "type": "rp",
}, "https://our.alfa.facebook.com")

//
const openedWindow = window.open('https://www.google.com');

// Later, even after navigation, you can still use the stored reference
window.location.href = 'https://www.youtube.com';

// You can still send messages to the opened window using the stored reference
setTimeout(openedWindow.postMessage({
    "type": "message"
}, "https://example.com"),3000)
