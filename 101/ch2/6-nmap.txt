nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24 // scan all hosts within the network to get up ips
I can also give it group of ips to scan
  echo "192.168.1.0/24/24" >ipsFile
  nmap -sn -iL ipsFile
sudo nmap -O 192.168.1.1,101,105 // know the os of these address and services they are using
nmap 192.168.1.101 // he got back all ports that exists on tcp with their services
  nmap by default looks for tcp ports and looks for the most popular 1000 ports
  sudo nmap -sU 192.168.1.101 // now it gives the udp ports only
-nmap could report to which service these ports probably corresponds to
  // for ezample port 80 probably corresponds to a web server
  nmap -sV 192.168.1.101
