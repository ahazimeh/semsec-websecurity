red team (offensive security) vs blue team(defensive security)
black hat vs white hat vs gray hat

Penetration testing phases
  information gathering
  vulnerability assesment: look for security holes
  exploitation
  post exploitation: after exploitation, check if we can stay inside machine for example
  reporting

Penetration testing
  performed during a specific time period
  follow a systemetic and structured approach
  payment: paid per project
Bug Bounty
  typically run continuously
  decentralized and crowd-sourced approach
  reward: per valid report

setting up the lab
  Nat: virtual machine have specific address over the internet, this address is only clear for the main os
  Bridged adapter: os is separate pc from virtual machine on the same network

linux commands
  find . -type f -name page.tsx // d rather than f for directory
  locate nmap // it looks for files that were added, updates every 24 hours, I can force updating it

Users privileges
  adduser majddhani sudo
update: update list of repository that have the packages and tools
updagrade: conntect to repository and upgrade these packages and  tools

Port:
  open ports: sudo netstat -tulpn

traceroute google.com // path of request

sudo service apache2 start // status and stop


 Breaking Encryption
A brief overview of some common methods used to break encryption:
Brute force attacks: (Caesar cipher)
  In this method, an attacker tries every possible combination of characters until they find the right decryption key
Cryptanalysis:
  This involves analyzing the algorithm used to encrypt the message and exploiting weaknesses in the algorithm to decrypt the message.
Social engineering:
  This method involves tricking or persuading someone to reveal the encryption key or password, which can be easier than trying to break the encryption itself.

hash sum can be used to detect whether the file wasn't modified while being delivered

you can encrypt something with private key as a signature
