whoami
open (os specific) -> alternative: xdg-open . // open a file
less and more
wc: word count
sort fileName
unique:
  reports or omits repeated lines // remove adjacet similar lines
  so it can be uesd with sort

expansion
  echo ~ $PATH * ?
  echo {a,b,c}.txt
  touch app.{js,html,css,py}
  so basically the shell expands some smaller things into a larger pieces of text

diff: difference between 2 files // -u and -y

du: find sizes of files and directories on machine // give it a path

du -h | sort -hr | tail // get the largest files

df: information of the mounted files // how much these files are taking memory

ps: process

ps -ax: all processes initiated by all users

top: tells us top cpu intensive processes
top -o mem // sort by memory, it didn't work

killall provide a name rather than id, such
  killall -9 node

jobs, bg, fg

jobs, you can check stopped processes
fg 2

gzip compression
gzip -k filename // keep original file
unzip: gzip -d or use gunzip

tar to combine several files together
tar // z flag to compress as well

aliasa // alias myls='ls -la'
  I can define aliases in .bash_aliases or bashrc // depending on distr
on mac I can define them inside .zshrc

single qutations don't allow expansion but double do

xargs take output of 1 command and take it into argument for second command
ls | sort // we are not passing arguments, sort is setup to accept values through standard inputs
also setup to accept arguments
so for rm this won't work
  cat deadPlayers.txt | rm
this will work
  cat deadPlayers.txt | xargs rm

ln (hardlink and softlink)

ln original.txt hardlink.txt
ln -s original.txt symlink.txt // if original got deleted then this will break

who tells me users that are logged in

passwd // change someone password
passwd elvis

chown and chmod
