Why information disclosure occured?
  Misconfiguration
  Improper Error Handling - Stack Trace Error (extra information being sent)
  Inferring (send 2 calls each time with a certain scenario)
  Flawed design (design of application is wrong where there is a feature shows information that is supposed to be confidential)
  Leaked information (leak information to 3rd party library or any component)

/.git
wget -r giturl

stack trace error should only be for the developers cause it can cause information to be leaked
  source code
  function names
  piece of source code
  memory address and system resources
  debugging and system information (log files, system parameters)

provide unexpected parameter and get back error which can contain sensitive information

apis overfetching can provide sensitive information

inferring (send 2 different requests and try to conclude something)

flowed design:

send sensitive data to 3rd party

misrepresentation of info (as fb mentioned that only you can see your email and phone number when the default behavior was for different)

dirsearch -u link

intitle: "index of /" site: "x.com"
