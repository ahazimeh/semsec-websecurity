same site
domain (.domain) // will send the cookie to all subdomains // domain sends the cookie cross site (it cars about be url)

same site
  if I click on a button from outside of a site to go to certain site the cookie should not be used
    (it compares protocol, domain, and TLD(top level domain) )
      // subdomain are ignored so it is same site
      // also for port

  changing the url manually

same site: (strict, lax, none)
  it is going to be sent whether it is same site, cross site...
  when it is strict if I come from a different website I will not be able to send the cookies
  lax will send the cookie when navigating through (top level navigation, and the request type is get)
