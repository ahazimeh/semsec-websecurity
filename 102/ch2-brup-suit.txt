Burp Suite
Charles Proxy
MITMProxey
Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)

setting -> search:font -> display -> dark

proxy -> http history

I can highlight and comment and then above filter by highlight or comment

Bambda mode: (now I want to look for responses that got the word hacking)
if(requestResponse.response().contains("hacking", false)) {
  return true;
  }
  return false;


if(requestResponse.response().statusCode() === 301) {
  return true;
  }
  return false


if(requestResponse.response().statusCode() === 301) {
  requestResponse.annotations().setHighlightColor(HighlightColor.RED) // highlight this response
  return true;
}
  return true;

-show only in scope items (to show for example only requests to facebook.com)
  after checking it go to target -> scope settings -> Target scopes
  http://semsec.org/ plus include all subdomains
-I can also download scope settings then
  go to project -> project settings then load

Target -> sitemap: I am able to view the response I got from the website (images ...) // filtering here is same as http history

Foxy Proxy:
  redirect requests only in a certain browser

proxy settings -> response intercept rule, I can check request intercept rules to let burp intercept responses as well
request, response, and ws interception rules

manage group: right click on tab and add to a group

burp settings -> match and replace -> add
  type: Request header
  Match: Referer: https://.. // keep empty if I want to add rather than match and replace
  replace: Referer: ht....
  // only apple to in scope items

decoder
  I can decode by selecting it in the inspector

intruder: brute force

intruder attacks:
  Sniper
  Battering Ram
  Pitchfork
  Cluster Bomb

sniper (will accept 1 payload set)
Battering Ram (will accept 1 payload set) // but it will update all payloads with the same value
Pitchfork (will accept several payload set) // each file will loop once
Cluster Bomb (will accept several payload set) // but here it will look for all combinations

comparer: compares difference between 2 requests or responses

logger++: I can search for keywords (it is available for pro version of burp as well)
