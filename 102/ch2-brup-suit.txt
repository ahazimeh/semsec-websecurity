Burp Suite
Charles Proxy
MITMProxey
Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)

setting -> search:font -> display -> dark

proxy -> http history

I can highlight and comment and then above filter by highlight or comment

Bambda mode: (now I want to look for responses that got the word hacking)
if(requestResponse.response().contains("hacking", false)) {
  return true;
  }
  return false;


if(requestResponse.response().statusCode() === 301) {
  return true;
  }
  return false


if(requestResponse.response().statusCode() === 301) {
  requestResponse.annotations().setHighlightColor(HighlightColor.RED) // highlight this response
  return true;
}
  return true;

-show only in scope items (to show for example only requests to facebook.com)
  after checking it go to target -> scope settings -> Target scopes
  http://semsec.org/ plus include all subdomains
-I can also download scope settings then
  go to project -> project settings then load

Target -> sitemap: I am able to view the response I got from the website (images ...) // filtering here is same as http history

Foxy Proxy:
  redirect requests only in a certain browser

proxy settings -> response intercept rule, I can check request intercept rules to let burp intercept responses as well
request, response, and ws interception rules
