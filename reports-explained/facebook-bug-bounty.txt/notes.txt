  check for endpoints on js files
  aspxauth cookie
  find 2 applications using aspxauth cookies
    App1 allows registration and App2 don't
    they must be running on the same server
    you must know the username from App1
    validation and decryption keys are shared between these 2 applications

    so with multiple websites running on same server will have same keys

    *summary: 2 applications using same keys
