fetch 2 requests // 1 that has no result and the other which may contain results
then check for timing and if there is big difference the probably the other request returned data

the browser will put the first request in a single single envelop waiting for the response
after the other requests will be packed together in a single envelop if they are short (since they are in the queue)
so we can send 1 big reqeust (big body) which will be sent in a single envelop and then put the 2 requests in another envelop
