zipslip // use path traversal zip file to access system files
  you can unzip a file into a different location and turn it into rce

Yes, uploading non-PHP files can still lead to RCE in certain scenarios:
1-SVG files:
<?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes"?>
<!DOCTYPE test [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <script>alert(xxe)</script>
</svg>
2-ZIP files can trigger:
Path traversal
Zip slip
Zip bombs
Archive command injection
3-Image files with malicious metadata that gets processed:
ImageMagick vulnerabilities (ImageTragick)
ExifTool command injection
4-CSV files in Excel:
=cmd|' /C calc'!A0
5-Files that trigger vulnerabilities in processing libraries:
PDF processors
Media converters
Thumbnail generators

Key point: Any file that gets processed by server-side tools could potentially lead to RCE if those tools have vulnerabilities.
